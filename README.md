# Pathfinding Visualizer

A **Pathfinding Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that demonstrates popular pathfinding algorithms visually on a grid.  

This project helps in understanding how different algorithms explore nodes and find the shortest path in real-time.

## üîπ Features

- Interactive grid where you can:
  - Place **start** and **end** nodes
  - Add **obstacles/walls** to block paths
- Visualize popular pathfinding algorithms:
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
  - **A* Search Algorithm**
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- Real-time animation of the algorithm exploring nodes.
- Reset and clear grid functionality.

## ‚ö° How to Use

1. Open the visualizer in your browser.
2. Click on the grid to set the **start** and **end** nodes.
3. Add walls by clicking or dragging on grid cells.
4. Select an algorithm from the dropdown.
5. Click **Visualize** to see the algorithm in action.
6. Use **Reset Grid** to clear and try again.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5** ‚Äì Structure of the grid and controls
- **CSS3** ‚Äì Styling and animations
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Algorithm logic and grid manipulation

## üîç How It Works

1. The grid is represented as a 2D array.
2. Nodes can have states: **start, end, visited, wall, or path**.
3. Selected algorithm updates node states step by step.
4. Visual animations show which nodes are visited and the shortest path found.
